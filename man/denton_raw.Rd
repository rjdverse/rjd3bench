\title{Benchmarking of an atypical frequency series by means of the Denton method.}
\usage{
denton_raw(
  s = NULL,
  t,
  freqratio,
  d = 1L,
  mul = TRUE,
  modified = TRUE,
  conversion = c("Sum", "Average", "Last", "First", "UserDefined"),

}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Preliminary series. If not NULL, it must be a numeric vector.}

\item{t}{Aggregation constraint. Mandatory. It must be a numeric vector.}

\item{freqratio}{Frequency ratio between the benchmarked series and the
aggregation constraint. Mandatory. It must be a positive integer.}

\item{d}{Differencing order. 1 by default.}

\item{mul}{Multiplicative or additive benchmarking. Multiplicative by
default.}

\item{modified}{Modified (TRUE) or unmodified (FALSE) Denton. Modified by
default.}

\item{conversion}{Conversion rule. Usually "Sum" or "Average". Sum by
default.}

\item{obsposition}{Position of the observation in the aggregated period (only
used with "UserDefined" conversion).}

\item{startoffset}{Number of initial observations in the indicator(s) series that are prior to
the period covered by the low-frequency series.
Must be 0 or a positive integer. 0 by default. Ignored when no preliminary series is provided.}

\item{nbcsts}{Number of backcast periods. Ignored when a preliminary series
is provided. (not yet implemented)}

\item{nfcsts}{Number of forecast periods. Ignored when a preliminary series
is provided. (not yet implemented)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector. The benchmarked series.

\description{
Denton method relies on the principle of movement preservation. There exist a
few variants corresponding to different definitions of movement preservation:
additive first difference (AFD), proportional first difference (PFD),
additive second difference (ASD), proportional second difference (PSD), etc.
The default and most widely used is the Denton PFD method. This "raw"
function extends the denton() function in a way that it can deal with any
frequency ratio between the preliminary series and the aggregation
constraint.
