\title{Temporal disaggregation of an atypical frequency series by regression models.}
\usage{
temporal_disaggregation_raw(
  series,
  constant = TRUE,
  trend = FALSE,
  indicators = NULL,
  startoffset = 0L,
  model = c("Ar1", "Rw", "RwAr1"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{The low frequency series that will be disaggregated. Must be a numeric vector.}

\item{constant}{Constant term (T/F). Only used with "Ar1" model when zeroinitialization = F.}

\item{trend}{Linear trend (T/F)}

\item{indicators}{High-frequency indicator(s) used in the temporal disaggregation.
If not NULL, it must be either a numeric vector or a matrix.}

\item{startoffset}{Number of initial observations in the indicator(s) series that are prior to
the start of the period covered by the low-frequency series.
Must be 0 or a positive integer. 0 by default. Ignored when no indicator is provided.}

\item{model}{Model of the error term (at the disaggregated level).
"Ar1" = Chow-Lin, "Rw" = Fernandez, "RwAr1" = Litterman.}

\item{freqratio}{Frequency ratio between the disaggregated series and the low frequency series.
Mandatory. Must be a positive integer.}

\item{average}{Average conversion (T/F). Default is F, which means additive conversion.}

\item{rho}{(Initial) value of the parameter. Only used with Ar1/RwAr1 models.}

\item{rho.fixed}{Fixed rho (T/F, F by default)}

\item{rho.truncated}{Range for Rho evaluation (in [rho.truncated, 1[)}

\item{zeroinitialization}{The initial values of an auto-regressive model are
fixed to 0 (T/F, F by default)}

\item{diffuse.algorithm}{Algorithm used for diffuse initialization.
"SqrtDiffuse" by default}

\item{diffuse.regressors}{Indicates if the coefficients of the regression
model are diffuse (T) or fixed unknown (F, default)}

\item{nbcsts}{Number of backcast periods. Ignored when an indicator is provided.}

\item{nfcsts}{Number of forecast periods. Ignored when an indicator is provided.}

\description{
Perform temporal disaggregation of low frequency to high frequency time
series by regression models. Models included are Chow-Lin, Fernandez,
Litterman and some variants of those algorithms. This "raw" function extends
the temporal_disaggregation() function in a way that it can deal with any
frequency ratio.
}
\examples{
# use of chow-lin method to disaggregate a biennial series with an annual indicator
Y <- stats::aggregate(rjd3toolkit::Retail$RetailSalesTotal, 0.5)
x <- stats::aggregate(rjd3toolkit::Retail$FoodAndBeverageStores, 1)
td <- temporal_disaggregation_raw(as.numeric(Y), indicators = as.numeric(x), freqratio = 2)
td$estimation$disagg

# use of Fernandez method to disaggregate a series without indicator considering a frequency ratio of 5 (for example, it could be a quinquennial series to disaggregate on an annual basis)
Y2 <- c(500,510,525,520)
td2 <- temporal_disaggregation_raw(Y2, model = "Rw", freqratio = 5, nfcsts = 2)
td2$estimation$disagg

# same with an indicator, considering an offset in the latter
Y2 <- c(500,510,525,520)
x2 <- c(97,
        98, 98.5, 99.5, 104, 99,
        100, 100.5, 101, 105.5, 103,
        104.5, 103.5, 104.5, 109, 104,
        107, 103, 108, 113, 110)
td3 <- temporal_disaggregation_raw(Y2, indicators = x2, startoffset = 1, model = "Rw", freqratio = 5)
