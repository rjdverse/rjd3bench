\title{Interpolation of an atypical frequency series by regression models.}
\usage{
temporal_interpolation_raw(
  series,
  constant = TRUE,
  trend = FALSE,
  indicators = NULL,
  startoffset = 0L,
  model = c("Ar1", "Rw", "RwAr1"),
  freqratio,
  obsposition = -1L,
  rho = 0,
  rho.fixed = FALSE,
  rho.truncated = 0,
  zeroinitialization = FALSE,
  diffuse.algorithm = c("SqrtDiffuse", "Diffuse", "Augmented"),
  diffuse.regressors = FALSE,
  nbcsts = 0L,
  nfcsts = 0L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{The low frequency series that will be interpolated. Must be a numeric vector.}

\item{constant}{Constant term (T/F). Only used with "Ar1" model when zeroinitialization = F.}

\item{trend}{Linear trend (T/F, F by default)}

\item{indicators}{High-frequency indicator(s) used in the interpolation.
If not NULL, it must be either a numeric vector or a matrix.}

\item{startoffset}{Number of initial observations in the indicator(s) series
  that are prior to the first observation of the low-frequency series.
Must be 0 or a positive integer. 0 by default. Ignored when no indicator is provided.}

\item{model}{Model of the error term (at the higher-frequency level).
"Ar1" = Chow-Lin, "Rw" = Fernandez, "RwAr1" = Litterman.}

\item{freqratio}{Frequency ratio between the interpolated series and the low frequency series.
Mandatory. Must be a positive integer.}

\item{obsposition}{Integer. Position of the observations of the low frequency
series in the interpolated series. (e.g. 1st month of the year, 2d month of
the year, etc.). It must be a positive integer or -1 (the default). The
default value is equivalent to setting the value of the parameter equal to
the frequency of the series, meaning that the last value of the
interpolated series is consistent with the low frequency series.}

\item{rho}{(Initial) value of the parameter. Only used with Ar1/RwAr1 models.}

\item{rho.fixed}{Fixed rho (T/F, F by default)}

\item{rho.truncated}{Range for Rho evaluation (in [rho.truncated, 1[)}

\item{zeroinitialization}{The initial values of an auto-regressive model are
fixed to 0 (T/F, F by default)}

\item{diffuse.algorithm}{Algorithm used for diffuse initialization.
"SqrtDiffuse" by default}

\item{diffuse.regressors}{Indicates if the coefficients of the regression
model are diffuse (T) or fixed unknown (F, default)}

\item{nbcsts}{Number of backcast periods. Ignored when an indicator is provided.}

\item{nfcsts}{Number of forecast periods. Ignored when an indicator is provided.}

\description{
Perform temporal interpolation of low frequency to high frequency time
series by regression models. Models included are Chow-Lin, Fernandez,
Litterman and some variants of those algorithms. This "raw" function extends
the temporal_interpolation() function in a way that it can deal with any
frequency ratio.

\examples{

# use of chow-lin method to interpolate a biennial series with an annual indicator
# (low frequency series consistent with the last value of the interpolated series)
Y <- stats::aggregate(rjd3toolkit::Retail$RetailSalesTotal, 0.5)
x <- stats::aggregate(rjd3toolkit::Retail$FoodAndBeverageStores, 1)
ti <- temporal_interpolation_raw(as.numeric(Y), indicators = as.numeric(x), freqratio = 2)
ti$estimation$interp

# use of Fernandez method to interpolate a series without indicator considering a frequency ratio of 5 (for example, it could be a quinquennial series to interpolate annually)
# (low frequency series consistent with the last value of the interpolated series)
Y2 <- c(500,510,525,520)
ti2 <- temporal_interpolation_raw(Y2, model = "Rw", freqratio = 5, nbcsts = 1, nfcsts = 2)
ti2$estimation$interp

# same with an indicator, considering an offset in the latter

        535, 515, 540, 565, 550)
ti3 <- temporal_interpolation_raw(Y2, indicators = x2, startoffset = 1, model = "Rw", freqratio = 5)
