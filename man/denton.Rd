\title{Benchmarking by means of the Denton method.}
\usage{
denton(
  s = NULL,
  t,
  d = 1L,
  mul = TRUE,
  nfreq = 4L,
  modified = TRUE,
  conversion = c("Sum", "Average", "Last", "First", "UserDefined"),
  obsposition = 1L,
  nbcsts = 0L,
  nfcsts = 0L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Preliminary series. If not NULL, it must be the same class as t.}

\item{t}{Aggregation constraint. Mandatory. it must be either an object of
class ts or a numeric vector.}

\item{d}{Differencing order. 1 by default.}

\item{mul}{Multiplicative or additive benchmarking. Multiplicative by
default.}

\item{nfreq}{Annual frequency of the disaggregated variable. Used if no
disaggregated series is provided.}

\item{modified}{Modified (TRUE) or unmodified (FALSE) Denton. Modified by
default.}

\item{conversion}{Conversion rule. Usually "Sum" or "Average". Sum by
default.}

\item{obsposition}{Position of the observation in the aggregated period (only
used with "UserDefined" conversion).}

\item{nbcsts}{Number of backcast periods. Ignored when a preliminary
series is provided. (not yet implemented)}

\item{nfcsts}{Number of forecast periods. Ignored when a preliminary
series is provided. (not yet implemented)}
}
\value{
The benchmarked series is returned
}
\description{
Denton method relies on the principle of movement preservation. There exist a
few variants corresponding to different definitions of movement preservation:
additive first difference (AFD), proportional first difference (PFD),
additive second difference (ASD), proportional second difference (PSD), etc.
The default and most widely used is the Denton PFD method.
}
\examples{
Y <- rjd3toolkit::aggregate(rjd3toolkit::Retail$RetailSalesTotal, 1)

# denton PFD without a preliminary series
y1 <- denton(t = Y, nfreq = 4)
print(y1)

# denton PFD without a preliminary series and conversion = "Average"
denton(t = Y, nfreq = 4, conversion = "Average")

# denton PFD with a preliminary series
x <- y1 + rnorm(n = length(y1), mean = 0, sd = 10000)
denton(s = x, t = Y)

# denton AFD with a preliminary series
denton(s = x, t = Y, mul = FALSE)
