\title{Benchmarking by means of the Denton method.}
\usage{
denton(
  s = NULL,
  t,
  d = 1,
  mul = TRUE,
  nfreq = 4,
  modified = TRUE,
  conversion = c("Sum", "Average", "Last", "First", "UserDefined"),
  obsposition = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Disaggregated series. If not NULL, it must be the same class as t.}

\item{t}{Aggregation constraint. Mandatory. it must be either an object of class ts or a numeric vector.}

\item{d}{Differencing order. 1 by default}

\item{mul}{Multiplicative or additive benchmarking. Multiplicative by default}

\item{nfreq}{Annual frequency of the disaggregated variable. Used if no disaggregated series is provided.}

\item{modified}{Modified (TRUE) or unmodified (FALSE) Denton. Modified by default}

\item{conversion}{Conversion rule. Usually "Sum" or "Average". Sum by default.}

\item{obsposition}{Position of the observation in the aggregated period (only used with "UserDefined" conversion)}
}
\value{
The benchmarked series is returned
}
\description{
Denton method relies on the principle of movement preservation. There exist
a few variants corresponding to different definitions of movement
preservation: additive first difference (AFD), proportional first difference
(PFD), additive second difference (ASD), proportional second difference
(PSD), etc. The default and most widely adopted is the Denton PFD method.

\examples{
Y<-ts(qna_data$B1G_Y_data$B1G_FF, frequency=1, start=c(2009,1))

# denton PFD without high frequency series
y1<-rjd3bench::denton(t=Y, nfreq=4)

# denton ASD
x1<-y1+rnorm(n=length(y1), mean=0, sd=10)
y2<-rjd3bench::denton(s=x1, t=Y, d=2, mul=FALSE)

# denton PFD used for temporal disaggregation
x2 <- ts(qna_data$TURN_Q_data[,"TURN_INDEX_FF"], frequency=4, start=c(2009,1))
y3<-rjd3bench::denton(s=x2, t=Y)
