\title{Temporal disaggregation of a time series with ADL models}
\usage{
adl_disaggregation(
  series,
  constant = TRUE,
  trend = FALSE,
  indicators = NULL,
  average = FALSE,
  phi = 0,
  phi.fixed = FALSE,
  phi.truncated = 0,
  xar = c("FREE", "SAME", "NONE"),
  diffuse = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{The low frequency time series that will be disaggregated. It must be a ts object.}

\item{constant}{Constant term (T/F, T by default)}

\item{trend}{Linear trend (T/F, F by default)}

\item{indicators}{High-frequency indicator(s). It must be a (list of) ts object(s).}

\item{average}{Average conversion (T/F). Default is F, which means additive conversion.}

\item{phi}{(Initial) value of the phi parameter}

\item{phi.fixed}{Fixed phi (T/F, F by default)}

\item{phi.truncated}{Range for phi evaluation (in [phi.truncated, 1[)}

\item{xar}{Constraints on the coefficients of the lagged regression variables. See vignette for more information on this.}

\item{diffuse}{Indicates if the coefficients of the regression model are diffuse (T) or fixed unknown (F, default)}

Y <- ts(qna_data$B1G_Y_data[,"B1G_FF"], frequency = 1, start = c(2009,1))
x <- ts(qna_data$TURN_Q_data[,"TURN_INDEX_FF"], frequency = 4, start = c(2009,1))

# adl models with constraints
td2 <- adl_disaggregation(Y, indicators = x, xar = "SAME") # ~ Chow-Lin
td3 <- adl_disaggregation(Y, constant = FALSE, indicators = x, xar = "SAME", phi = 1, phi.fixed = TRUE) # ~ Fernandez
td4 <- adl_disaggregation(Y, indicators = x, xar = "NONE") # ~ Santos Silva-Cardoso
