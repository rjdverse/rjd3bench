\title{Temporal disaggregation of a time series by model-based Denton proportional method}
\usage{
denton_modelbased(
  series,
  indicator,
  differencing = 1,
  conversion = c("Sum", "Average", "Last", "First", "UserDefined"),
  conversion.obsposition = 1,
  outliers = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{Aggregation constraint. Mandatory. It must be either an object of class ts or a numeric vector.}

\item{indicator}{High-frequency indicator. Mandatory. It must be of same class as series}

\item{differencing}{Not implemented yet. Keep it equals to 1 (Denton PFD method).}

\item{conversion}{Conversion rule. Usually "Sum" or "Average". Sum by default.}

\item{conversion.obsposition}{Position of the observation in the aggregated period (only used with "UserDefined" conversion)}

\item{outliers}{a list of structured definition of the outlier periods and their intensity. The period must be submitted
first in the format YYYY-MM-DD and enclosed in quotation marks. This must be followed by an equal sign and
the intensity of the outlier, defined as the relative value of the 'innovation variances' (1= normal situation)}
}
\value{
an object of class 'JD3MBDenton'
}
\description{
Denton proportional method can be expressed as a statistical model in a State
space representation (see documentation for the definition of states). This
approach is interesting as it allows more flexibility in the model such as
the inclusion of outliers (level shift in the Benchmark to Indicator ratio)
that could otherwise induce unintended wave effects with standard Denton method.
Outliers and their intensity are defined by changing the value of the
'innovation variances'.
