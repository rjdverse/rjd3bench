\title{Temporal disaggregation of a time series by regression models.}
\usage{
temporal_disaggregation(
  series,
  constant = TRUE,
  trend = FALSE,
  indicators = NULL,
  model = c("Ar1", "Rw", "RwAr1"),
  freq = 4L,
  average = FALSE,
  rho = 0,
  rho.fixed = FALSE,
  rho.truncated = 0,

  diffuse.algorithm = c("SqrtDiffuse", "Diffuse", "Augmented"),
  diffuse.regressors = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{The low frequency time series that will be disaggregated. It must be a ts object.}

\item{constant}{Constant term (T/F). Only used with "Ar1" model when zeroinitialization = F.}

\item{trend}{Linear trend (T/F, F by default)}

\item{indicators}{High-frequency indicator(s) used in the temporal disaggregation.
It must be a (list of) ts object(s).}

\item{model}{Model of the error term (at the disaggregated level).
"Ar1" = Chow-Lin, "Rw" = Fernandez, "RwAr1" = Litterman.}

\item{freq}{Integer. Annual frequency of the disaggregated series.
Ignored when an indicator is provided.}

\item{average}{Average conversion (T/F). Default is F, which means additive conversion.}

\item{rho}{(Initial) value of the parameter. Only used with Ar1/RwAr1 models.}

\item{rho.fixed}{Fixed rho (T/F, F by default)}

\item{rho.truncated}{Range for rho evaluation (in [rho.truncated, 1[)}

\item{zeroinitialization}{The initial values of an auto-regressive model are
fixed to 0 (T/F, F by default)}

\item{diffuse.algorithm}{Algorithm used for diffuse initialization.
"SqrtDiffuse" by default.}

\item{diffuse.regressors}{Indicates if the coefficients of the regression
model are diffuse (T) or fixed unknown (F, default)}

\item{nbcsts}{Number of backcast periods. Ignored when an indicator is provided.}

\item{nfcsts}{Number of forecast periods. Ignored when an indicator is provided.}
}
\value{
An object of class "JD3TempDisagg"
}
\description{
Perform temporal disaggregation of low frequency to high frequency time
series by regression models. Models included are Chow-Lin, Fernandez,
Litterman and some variants of those algorithms.

\examples{
# chow-lin with monthly indicator
Y <- rjd3toolkit::aggregate(rjd3toolkit::Retail$RetailSalesTotal, 1)
x <- rjd3toolkit::Retail$FoodAndBeverageStores
td <- temporal_disaggregation(Y, indicators = x)

# fernandez with/without quarterly indicator

Y <- ts(qna_data$B1G_Y_data[,"B1G_FF"], frequency = 1, start = c(2009,1))
x <- ts(qna_data$TURN_Q_data[,"TURN_INDEX_FF"], frequency = 4, start = c(2009,1))
td1 <- temporal_disaggregation(Y, indicators = x, model = "Rw")
td1$estimation$disagg

td2 <- temporal_disaggregation(Y, model = "Rw", nfcsts = 6)
td2$estimation$disagg

# chow-lin on index series
Y_index <- 100 * Y / Y[1]
x_index <- 100 * x / x[1]
td3 <- temporal_disaggregation(Y, indicators = x, average = TRUE)
