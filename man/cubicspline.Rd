\title{Benchmarking by means of cubic splines}
\usage{
cubicspline(
  s = NULL,
  t,
  nfreq = 4,
  conversion = c("Sum", "Average", "Last", "First", "UserDefined"),
  obsposition = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Disaggregated series. If not NULL, it must be the same class as t.}

\item{t}{Aggregation constraint. Mandatory. it must be either an object of class ts or a numeric vector.}

\item{nfreq}{Annual frequency of the disaggregated variable. Used if no disaggregated series is provided.}

\item{conversion}{Conversion rule. Usually "Sum" or "Average". Sum by default.}

\item{obsposition}{Postion of the observation in the aggregated period (only used with "UserDefined" conversion)}
}
\description{
Cubic splines are piecewise cubic functions that are linked together in
a way to guarantee smoothness at data points. Additivity constraints are
added for benchmarking purpose and sub-period estimates are derived
from each spline. When a sub-period indicator (or disaggregated series) is
used, cubic splines are no longer drawn based on the low frequency data
but the Benchmark-to-Indicator (BI ratio) is the one being smoothed. Sub-
period estimates are then simply the product between the smoothed high
frequency BI ratio and the indicator.

\examples{
data("qna_data")
Y<-ts(qna_data$B1G_Y_data[,"B1G_FF"], frequency=1, start=c(2009,1))

# cubic spline without disaggregated series
y1<-rjd3bench::cubicspline(t=Y, nfreq=4)

# cubic spline with disaggregated series
x1<-y1+rnorm(n=length(y1), mean=0, sd=10)
y2<-rjd3bench::cubicspline(s=x1, t=Y)

# cubic splines used for temporal disaggregation
x2<-ts(qna_data$TURN_Q_data[,"TURN_INDEX_FF"], frequency=4, start=c(2009,1))
y3<-rjd3bench::cubicspline(s=x2, t=Y)
