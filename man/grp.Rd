\usage{
grp(
  s,
  t,
  conversion = c("Sum", "Average", "Last", "First", "UserDefined"),
  obsposition = 1,
  eps = 1e-12,
  iter = 500,
  dentoninitialization = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Preliminary series. Mandatory. It must be a ts object.}

\item{t}{Aggregation constraint. Mandatory. It must be a ts object.}

\item{conversion}{Conversion rule. "Sum" by default.}

\item{obsposition}{Integer. Position of the observation in the aggregated period
(only used with "UserDefined" conversion)}

\item{eps}{Numeric. Defines the convergence precision. BFGS algorithm
is run until the reduction in the objective is within this eps value
(1e-12 is the default) or until the maximum number of iterations is hit.}

\item{iter}{Integer. Maximum number of iterations in BFGS algorithm (500 is
the default).}

\item{dentoninitialization}{indicate whether the series benchmarked via
modified Denton PFD is used as starting values of the GRP optimization
procedure (TRUE/FALSE, TRUE by default). If FALSE, the average benchmark is
used for flow variables (e.g. t/4 for quarterly series with annual
constraints and conversion = 'Sum'), or the benchmark for stock variables.}
}
\value{
The benchmarked series is returned
}
\description{
GRP is a method which explicitly preserves the period-to-period growth rates
of the preliminary series. It corresponds to the method of Cauley and Trager
(1981), using the solution proposed by Di Fonzo and Marini (2011). BFGS is
used as line-search algorithm for the reduced unconstrained minimization
problem.
