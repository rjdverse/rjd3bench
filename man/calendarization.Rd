\usage{
calendarization(
  calendarobs,
  freq,
  start = NULL,
  end = NULL,
  dailyweights = NULL,
  stde = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{calendarobs}{A named list with the observed data. The list must be
composed of three elements: start, end and value, the first two
corresponding to the starting and ending date of the observation. See
example.}

\item{freq}{Annual frequency. If 0, only the daily series are computed.}

\item{start}{Starting day of the calendarization. Could be before the
starting date of the first observation (retropolation).}

\item{end}{Ending day of the calendarization. Could be after the ending date
of the last observation (extrapolation).}

\item{dailyweights}{Daily indicator values (or weights). Should have the same
  length as the requested series. If available, it typically reflects the
  daily level of activity that may be varying in function for instance of
seasonality, trading day or other calendar effects such as public holidays.}

\item{stde}{Boolean. If TRUE, the function also returns the standard errors
associated to the results. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
a list with the disaggregated daily values, the final aggregated
  results, and their associated errors if requested.
}
\description{
Time series data do not always coincide with calendar periods (e.g., fiscal
years starting in March-April or retail data collected in non-monthly
intervals). Calendarization is the process of transforming the values of a
flow time series observed over varying time intervals into values that cover
given calendar intervals such as month, quarter or year. The process involves
two steps. At first, a state-space representation of the Denton proportional
first difference (PFD) method is considered to perform a temporal
disaggregation of the observed data into daily values. After that, the
resulting daily values are aggregated into the desired calendar reference
periods.

\examples{

# Example 1 (from Quenneville et al (2012))

## Observed data
obs_1 <- list(
    list(start = "2009-02-18", end = "2009-03-17", value = 9000),
    list(start = "2009-03-18", end = "2009-04-14", value = 5000),
    list(start = "2009-04-15", end = "2009-05-12", value = 9500),
    list(start = "2009-05-13", end = "2009-06-09", value = 7000))

## a) calendarization in absence of daily indicator values (or weights)
cal_1a <- calendarization(obs_1, 12, end = "2009-06-30", dailyweights = NULL, stde = TRUE)

ym_1a <- cal_1a$rslt
eym_1a <- cal_1a$erslt
yd_1a <- cal_1a$days
eyd_1a <- cal_1a$edays

## b) calendarization in presence of daily indicator values (or weights)
x <- rep(c(1.0, 1.2, 1.8 , 1.6, 0.0, 0.6, 0.8), 19)
cal_1b <- calendarization(obs_1, 12, end = "2009-06-30", dailyweights = x, stde = TRUE)

ym_1b <- cal_1b$rslt
eym_1b <- cal_1b$erslt
yd_1b <- cal_1b$days
eyd_1b <- cal_1b$edays

# Example 2 (incl. negative value)

obs_2 <- list(
    list(start = "1980-01-01", end = "1989-12-31", value = 100),
    list(start = "1990-01-01", end = "1999-12-31", value = -10),
    list(start = "2000-01-01", end = "2002-12-31", value = 50))

cal_2 <- calendarization(obs_2, 4, end = "2003-12-31")

yq_2 <- cal_2$rslt
