\title{Interpolation of a time series by regression models.}
\usage{
temporal_interpolation(
  series,
  constant = TRUE,
  trend = FALSE,
  indicators = NULL,
  model = c("Ar1", "Rw", "RwAr1"),
  freq = 4L,
  obsposition = -1L,
  rho = 0,
  rho.fixed = FALSE,
  rho.truncated = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{The low frequency time series that will be interpolated. It must be a ts object.}

\item{constant}{Constant term (T/F). Only used with "Ar1" model when zeroinitialization = F.}

\item{trend}{Linear trend (T/F, F by default)}

\item{indicators}{High-frequency indicator(s) used in the interpolation.
It must be a (list of) ts object(s).}

\item{model}{Model of the error term (at the higher-frequency level).
"Ar1" = Chow-Lin, "Rw" = Fernandez, "RwAr1" = Litterman.}

\item{freq}{Integer. Annual frequency of the interpolated series.
Ignored when an indicator is provided.}

\item{obsposition}{Integer. Position of the observations of the low frequency
series in the interpolated series. (e.g. 1st month of the year, 2d month of
the year, etc.). It must be a positive integer or -1 (the default). The
default value is equivalent to setting the value of the parameter equal to
the frequency of the series, meaning that the last value of the
interpolated series is consistent with the low frequency series.}

\item{rho}{(Initial) value of the parameter. Only used with Ar1/RwAr1 models.}

\item{rho.fixed}{Fixed rho (T/F, F by default)}

\item{rho.truncated}{Range for rho evaluation (in [rho.truncated, 1[)}

\item{zeroinitialization}{The initial values of an auto-regressive model are
fixed to 0 (T/F, F by default)}

\item{diffuse.algorithm}{Algorithm used for diffuse initialization.
"SqrtDiffuse" by default.}

\item{diffuse.regressors}{Indicates if the coefficients of the regression
model are diffuse (T) or fixed unknown (F, default)}

\item{nbcsts}{Number of backcast periods. Ignored when an indicator is provided.}

\item{nfcsts}{Number of forecast periods. Ignored when an indicator is provided.}

An object of class "JD3Interpolation"

\description{
Perform temporal interpolation of low frequency to high frequency time
series by regression models. Models included are Chow-Lin, Fernandez,
Litterman and some variants of those algorithms.
}
\examples{
# chow-lin/fernandez when the last value of the interpolated series is
# consistent with the low frequency series.
Y <- rjd3toolkit::aggregate(rjd3toolkit::Retail$RetailSalesTotal, 1)
x <- rjd3toolkit::Retail$FoodAndBeverageStores
ti1 <- temporal_interpolation(Y, indicators = x)
ti1$estimation$interp

ti2 <- temporal_interpolation(Y, indicators = x, model = "Rw")
ti2$estimation$interp

# same without indicator
ti3 <- temporal_interpolation(Y, model = "Rw", freq = 12, nfcsts = 6)
ti3$estimation$interp

# consistent with the low frequency series.
ti4 <- temporal_interpolation(Y, indicators = x, obsposition = 1)
ti4$estimation$interp
